# Click away listener

<p class="description">Detect if a click event happened outside of an element. It listens for clicks that occur somewhere in the document.</p>

## Exemple

For instance, if you need to hide a menu dropdown when people click anywhere else on your page:

{{"demo": "pages/components/click-away-listener/ClickAway.js"}}

Notice that the component only accepts one child element. You can find a more advanced demo on the [Menu documentation section](/components/menus/#menulist-composition).
