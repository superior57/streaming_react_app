# Slider

<p class="description">Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.</p>

[Sliders](https://material.io/design/components/sliders.html) reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

## Discrete sliders

Discrete sliders can be adjusted to a specific value by referencing its value indicator.
By order of demos:

1. You can generate a mark for each step with `marks={true}`.
1. You can change the default step increment.
1. You can have custom marks by providing a rich array to the `marks` prop.
1. You can restrict the selectable values to those provided with the `marks` prop with `step={null}`.
1. You can force the thumb label to be always visible with `valueLabelDisplay="on"`.

## Track

The track shows the range available for user selection.

### Removed track

The track can be turned off with `track={false}`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/TrackFalseSlider.js"}}

### Inverted track

The track can be inverted with `track="inverted"`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/slider/TrackInvertedSlider.js"}}

## Non-linear scale

You can use the `scale` prop to represent the `value` on a different scale.
For instance, in the following demo, the value *x* represents the power of *10^x*.

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#slider)

The component handles most of the work necessary to make it accessible.
However, you need to make sure that:

- Each thumb has a user-friendly label (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `getAriaLabel` prop).
- Each thumb has a user-friendly text for its current value.
This is not required if the value matches the semantics of the label.
You can change the name with the `getAriaValueText` or `aria-valuetext` prop.
